<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Pricing Policy</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  The Company reserves the right to allow trailer owners to revise trailer rental rates at any time prior to accepting a reservation.<br />
  The rental rates shown are subject to revision by the trailer owner after a reservation is accepted in the event of an event affecting the change of delivery distance, change of delivery location, request for a different trailer, change, or addition of accessories.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">9. Payments</h2>
<p>All rentals are subject to rental fees, reservation fees, deposit processing fees, and other fees for additional options.</p>

<p>When you create a reservation, your credit card is authorized, but payment is not taken until the reservation is accepted.</p>

<p>Payment cards (credit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by your card issuer. If the Company does not receive the required authorization, it will not be liable for any delay in your booking.</p>

<p>The Company accepts all major credit cards as payment for rentals and no other form of payment will be accepted. The Company uses Stripe, a third-party payment processor. By using the services offered by the Company, you understand and agree that the Company is not responsible for any terms and conditions, limitations set by Stripe, or monetary actions taken by Stripe. This includes, but is not limited to, refunds, service fees, fraudulent charges, or any other fees imposed by Stripe.</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">10. Refusal of payment</h2>
<p>A chargeback occurs when the renter disputes a charge on your credit card. In the event a chargeback is initiated, Company will investigate whether the chargeback was justified. If not, Company will dispute the chargeback on behalf of Company and the trailer owner. Company will request the cooperation of the trailer owner to obtain the necessary details and documentation. Should Company lose a chargeback for any reason, the trailer owner will not be entitled to a refund.</p>

<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Rental Fees</h3>
<p>The Trailer Owner is responsible for setting the daily, weekly, and monthly rental fees, accessory rental fees, cleaning fees, delivery fees, and all other fees associated with the rental. If the Owner accepts a reservation, the Owner must honor the rental price stated in the reservation. The Trailer Owner is obligated to manage rental extensions and ensure that the Renter pays for the additional rental days through the "Rental Extension" link in the Renter’s account.</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">11. Security deposits</h2>
<p>The deposit amount is set by the trailer owner. All deposits are charged at the time of booking. If a booking is accepted, the deposit amount will be charged. The deposit or a portion thereof may be retained if a trailer is returned damaged or lost or if a rental accessory is not returned or is returned damaged. Other reasons why a deposit may be retained include, but are not limited to, late return of a rental trailer. If a trailer is returned on time and without incident, the deposit will be refunded in full which marks the end of the transaction. It may take several days for the deposit refund to appear on the renter's bank statement.</p>

<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Rental Period</h3>
<p>The “Rental Period” begins and ends on the date and time of the start and end of the reservation, unless the Owner and the Renter mutually agree to change the start and end time of the rental.</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">12. Rental extensions</h2>
<p>If Renter is unable to return on the scheduled date, Renter must go to the Company’s platform or mobile app and request an extension. Any verbal or written agreement to extend a rental outside of the Company’s platform will not include insurance coverage and will not be supported by the Company in collecting rental fees or other charges or withholding any deposit for damages, citations, tolls, or any other incident that occurs during the extended rental period if the rental period has not been paid through the Company’s platform. If an extension of the rental is not submitted by Renter, Renter agrees that Company has the authority to charge your credit card without prior authorization. If the extension request is not processed through the platform by Renter prior to the end of the rental date, insurance will not apply to the rental.</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">13. Prohibition on the use of rented trailers</h2>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">14. Costs incurred by the tenant</h2>
<p>Renter is responsible for payment of all charges, including but not limited to rental days, tolls, tickets, towing, impound, damage, cleaning, late fees, loss, abandonment, unreturned accessories, etc. If Renter is late in payment for any period and charges are unpaid at the end of the paid rental period, Renter agrees that Renter may charge Renter's credit card without prior authorization to pay the applicable charges.</p>

<p>Unpaid fees will be subject to an additional $30 administrative fee per Lorepa per incident or citation. Past due accounts will be sent to collections and will incur an additional 35% surcharge and may be reported to credit reporting agencies. You acknowledge that you have no right to dispute any charges imposed for such fees. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the trailer owner from any actions, consequences, or penalties associated with any activity or use while the trailer is in your possession.</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">15. Late Fees</h2>

</p>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">16. Non-use and Acceptance of the Condition</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Non-use and Acceptance of the Condition</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Renter acknowledges that by booking the rental and taking possession of the trailer, he accepts the condition and usability of the trailer and is fully responsible for full payment of the rental and any additional charges.<br />
  No refund will be considered in the event of the Hirer being unable to use the trailer, under any circumstances, for any reason after the Hirer has taken possession of the trailer. The Hirer agrees that while using the Company's platform and renting from trailer owners, the Company will not be held responsible for the condition or usability of any trailer rented.<br />
  It is the renter's responsibility to inspect the trailer prior to taking possession. Once the renter takes possession of the trailer, the renter accepts the condition and use of the trailer. Both the renter and the owner must take pictures of the trailer at the time of rental. If the renter discovers a defect or mechanical problem with any part of the trailer, including but not limited to lights, brakes, tires, suspension, electrical, durability or safety of the trailer, the renter must immediately notify the trailer owner and the company prior to taking possession of the trailer.<br />

</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">17. Damages</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Damages</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Any damage to the trailer during the rental period is the sole responsibility of the renter, not the owner or company. The renter is liable for any damage that cannot be proven to have existed prior to the rental. The renter is liable for damage even if repairs are never made. The owner is free to choose to make their own repairs, have them done by a workshop or not do them at all.<br />
  Renter shall ensure the safety and maintenance of the rented trailer during the rental period, at his own expense. Renter agrees to return the trailer in the same condition in which he received it.<br />
  Renter shall pay Owner full compensation for the replacement and/or repair of the rented trailer or attachments that are not returned due to being lost or stolen or any part of the trailer or attachment that is damaged and requires repair to return it to the same condition it was in at the time of rental. Renter agrees that Owner shall be entitled to hold Renter financially responsible for any such loss or damage by not returning the full or partial amount of the security deposit.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">18. Claim for Compensation for Withholding of Deposit</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Claim for Compensation for Withholding of Deposit</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  A security deposit deduction request is not insurance. It is a request to withhold some or all of the renter’s security deposit in the event of damage or loss. A loss is defined as physical damage to a trailer, missing or damaged rental accessories, or late return fees. All security deposit deduction requests must be submitted by checking the “Security Deposit Retention Request” box during the “End of Rental” process.<br />
  If a loss occurs and the trailer owner does not retain some or all of the deposit at the time of rental closing, the loss will not be recoverable by the company. A claim for damage deduction can only be filed for the loss of an accessory if the accessory was included in the rental and paid for as an additional accessory during the booking process. The company is not responsible for recovering charges for a trailer or accessory that is borrowed and is not listed as part of the rental list as part of the booking.<br />
  If the security deposit deduction claim cannot be filed immediately upon completion of the rental, you must immediately notify the Company of the damage or loss by emailing or messaging the Company. All security deposit deduction claims must be filed within 72 hours of the Renter returning the trailer. If a longer period of time is required to file a claim, you must notify the Company of the reason for the delay in filing the claim.<br />
  All claims for deposit deduction must include all images that clearly identify the damage or loss, a complete description of the damage or loss, and all receipts for repairs or replacement parts. The claim must provide a fair estimate of the cost of repair or replacement parts and labor. Any images, descriptions, receipts, or amounts of loss not listed in the claim will not be considered for deposit deduction.<br />
  A claim can only be filed once per rental. Claims cannot be edited once they have been submitted. In order for a claim to be considered for security deposit deduction, you must have uploaded photos at the start of the rental, photos at the end of the rental, and you must have been present with the renter at the start of the rental and at the end of the rental. If you are not present when the renter receives and returns the trailer, the company may deny your claim for damage deduction if the damage or loss cannot be proven or if there is doubt that the renter caused the damage or loss.<br />
  The company can only hold the full amount of the deposit. The company will assess the cost of replacements, repairs and labor based on market value. Repairs must be limited to the part(s) involved. For example, if the renter runs over a nail and causes one (1) tire to blow out, the renter is responsible for the cost of replacing one (1) tire and not the other tires if they were not damaged. Or, if a paint scratch occurs, the renter is responsible for the cost of repairing the scratch; the cost of repainting the entire trailer will be disallowed.<br />
  If the Renter has an objection to the claim after it has been opened but before it is closed, the Renter must contact the Company immediately upon receiving notification of the claim. The Trailer Owner and the Trailer Renter agree that the Company will make the final decision on the outcome of the claim for deduction of the deposit, including the amount of money withheld from the deposit.<br />
  All claims will be processed within 48 business hours or less unless further investigation is required. The Trailer Owner and Trailer Renter agree that once a claim has been approved or denied, the decision is final and cannot be reopened or appealed unless the Company chooses to do so.<br />
  Once the claim is closed, the trailer renter and trailer owner agree not to dispute the claim with each other or with the Company or the renter's credit card company. Harassment by the trailer owner or trailer renter is automatic grounds for permanent removal from the platform. You agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any and all liability for our decision not to refund all or part of your deposit due to damages, losses, or any disputes that may arise before, during, or after a reservation or rental.
</p>
<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">19. UNINSURED RENTALS</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Uninsured Rentals</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Any rental processed on the Company Platform without insurance for any reason, including, but not limited to, refusal, software glitch, or incomplete information, will be your responsibility to provide outside coverage or self-insure. You agree to release the Company from any liability for any bookings generated without insurance coverage and for any physical damage to your trailer, vehicle, third-party property, bodily injury or death, accident, loss of time, loss of income, or any other liability or incident involving a rental for which insurance was not included or offered for any reason during your rental.

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Renter accepts liability while the trailer is in his possession. Renter agrees to provide his own liability coverage and to release the owner and company from any liability during the rental period.<br />
  The trailer owner agrees to release the company from any liability in the event of an incident occurring during the rental. The company is not responsible for any verbal or written agreements, statements or any other means of communication between the renter and the owner.<br />
  The Tenant and the Owner understand and agree that the Company is not obligated to provide advice or review communication and is not required to correct any miscommunication of the Company's policy or any other procedure or to monitor the conduct of the Tenant or the Owner. The Company is not responsible for conducting background checks or ensuring any level of trustworthiness, credibility or qualification of a Tenant or Owner.<br />
  By using the Company's Services, you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any damages, losses, or criminal or civil litigation arising out of the conduct of business and use of the Company's Platform and Services.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">21. Termination of rental</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Termination of Rental</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  The Renter shall not pledge or encumber the rented trailer in any way. The Owner may terminate the rental immediately if the Renter fails to comply with the rules set forth in the Rental Terms.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">22. Non-restitution</h2>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">29. Rental procedures for owners</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Rental Procedures for Owners</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Trailer owners are required to review the “Getting Started” guide and the “Rental Process Guide”, located in the Owner Dashboard Library, when creating an account.<br />
  Trailer Owners are responsible for managing their own reservations, rental extensions, and responding to questions from renters or potential renters in a timely manner. Owners who do not respond within a reasonable time will receive automated and/or direct contact from the Company.<br />
  All bookings must be accepted or declined as soon as possible or within one hour, if possible, by the trailer owner. If no action is taken to accept or decline a booking within 24 hours, the booking will be declined by the Company and the registration and user account may be deactivated at any time at the Company's discretion.<br />
  The Trailer Owner must respond to all messages as soon as possible or within one hour, if possible. If messages are ignored or go unanswered by the Trailer Owner, the listing and user account may be deactivated at any time at the Company's discretion.<br />
  Trailer Owner agrees that after accepting a reservation, the Trailer Owner is obligated to fulfill the rental. If the Trailer Owner accepts a reservation and is unable to provide the trailer to the Renter on the agreed upon date and time and is unable to reschedule the reservation and must cancel the reservation request, Company reserves the right to charge the Trailer Owner any applicable reservation fees of the total transaction amount to Company to cover credit card and advertising fees, except as provided in the Trailer Owner's reservation cancellation policy.<br />
  If for any reason the trailer is not available on the scheduled rental date and time, the trailer owner must notify the trailer renter in advance and may offer to reschedule the rental to a mutually convenient date and time. The trailer owner must be present at the time of rental and return to assist and follow all steps provided in the “Rental Process Guide” located in your user account library.<br />
  Trailer owners are required to manage rentals by meeting with renters to hand over the trailer. Owners must upload at least four recent photos of the rental trailer before and after each rental and indicate the condition of the trailer. If the trailer is damaged upon return, photos and a description of the damage must be noted on the “Deposit Deduction Request” before the rental ends.<br />
  Trailer owners must start the rental from their account by selecting the “Start Rental” option immediately after returning the trailer to the renter. Trailer owners must end the rental from their account by selecting the “End Rental” option immediately after receiving the trailer when it is returned by the renter. An end of rental period may be required for damage assessment.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">30. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OWNER’S RENTAL PROCEDURES</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Failure to Comply with Owner’s Rental Procedures</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  If an accepted reservation has not been sent on the date and time scheduled by the Platform by selecting “Start Rental” or received on the date and time scheduled by selecting “End Rental”, the Platform’s customer service will attempt to contact you one (1) time to remind you to start or end the rental. Any further delay in performing the rental start or end function will be considered a failure to comply with the rental procedures.<br />
  The company reserves the right to refuse an “accepted” or “renting” reservation at any time for failure to follow rental procedures. Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of your payment depending on the circumstances and whether or not the renter has taken possession of the trailer. The penalty for failure to follow rental procedures is at the sole discretion of the company.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">31. Trailer Maintenance Requirements</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Trailer Maintenance Requirements</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Owner agrees that the rental trailer is well maintained, roadworthy and mechanically safe, in good cosmetic condition, has a current license plate associated with the rental trailer, has a manufacturer VIN sticker indicating weight specifications including weight capacity, and has a current DOT inspection if required by state law.<br />
  It is the responsibility of each trailer owner to ensure that the electrical and mechanical components of the trailer are in good working order at all times prior to each rental, including but not limited to tires, spare tires, axles, bearings, hubs, drums, brakes, leaf springs, shackle links, suspensions, electrical wiring, hitch, hitch lock, safety chains, breakaway box, breakaway cable, frame, breakaway battery, bed, structure, walls, lights, hinges, doors, running boards, etc.<br />
  You agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any mechanical, electrical or structural failure of any Rented Trailer or from the communication or miscommunication of any instructions or misrepresentation regarding any Rented Trailer and its specifications contained on the Company Platform, Trailer Listing Page or other advertising materials.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">32. Owner Payments</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Owner Payments</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Owner payments are controlled by Company0 (the trailer owner). A payment is automatically initiated when you end the rental by selecting the “End Rental” button associated with the reservation. A payment typically takes 2-3 business days from the time you end the rental to arrive in your bank account. Holidays, weekends, restrictions on your account, or not setting up your bank account will delay payments. You must add your bank account information by selecting “My Bank Account” in your account to receive payments.<br />
  You will not be entitled to a payment for any booking transaction that is associated with or suspected of fraud, or for any booking transaction for which a dispute is lost due to the bank ruling in favor of the cardholder. If you have already received payment, the money will be deducted from your next payment.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">33. Cancellation of the Reservation by the Owner</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Cancellation of the Reservation by the Owner</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  Trailer owners are allowed to cancel up to two times within a six-month period without a fee. Subsequent cancellations by the trailer owner will incur a $100 fee if the cancellation occurs at least 2 days before the rental begins. The fee is deducted from the trailer owner's future payment. Any cancellation requests after the rental has started or been sent will be denied. Owner cancellations are only for unavoidable circumstances. The company will use reasonable judgment in determining what constitutes an “unavoidable circumstance”. Any cancellation by the owner in an attempt to circumvent the platform will be considered abuse of service.
</p>

<h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">34. Abuse of Services</h2>
<h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-800 text-left">Abuse of Services</h3>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
  By using Lorepa's services, you agree not to attempt to circumvent the Platform. Any Trailer Owner who attempts to circumvent the Platform in any way by attempting to exchange contact information, attempting to establish a meeting location, or sharing any other information that may prevent the booking from being completed on the Platform prior to an accepted booking is in violation of these Terms.<br />
  Any Trailer Owner who uses contact information shared by a Renter in violation of these Terms prior to an accepted booking is in violation of these Terms. Any Trailer Owner who baits a Renter into circumventing the Platform is in violation of these Terms. Any Trailer Owner who causes or attempts to cause the Renter to cancel the booking after it has been accepted in order to circumvent the Platform is in violation of these Terms.<br />
  If the Company, in its reasonable judgment, believes that the Trailer Owner has abused the Terms of Service and circumvented the Platform in any way or caused the Rental or a potential Rental to be removed from the Platform, Lorepa reserves the right to charge all applicable booking fees and a $200 administrative fee to the Trailer Owner. The Company reserves the right to block or permanently delete any user account at any time and for any reason.
